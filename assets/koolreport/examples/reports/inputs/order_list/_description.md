This example demonstrates the basic usage of widgets in `Inputs` package. The example uses `DateRangePicker` and `MultiSelect` widget to let user input range of date and list of customer. Upon recieving date range and list of customers as inputs, the report will list all orders of those customers within selected date range.

Although, it is not required but very essential to build dynaamic reports or dashboards. If you dont use `Inputs` package, it is fine. You can construct your own form to let user keys and then you use them as parameters for reports. `Inputs` package does the samething so that you don't need to do it.
