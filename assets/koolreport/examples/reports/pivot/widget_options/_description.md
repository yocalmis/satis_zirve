This example shows new features of Pivot table:

1. __Hide Sub Total Rows__: By default, pivot showing sub total for each data group which is very useful but could take some space. If you do not like this default option, you may set `"hideSubtotalRow"` to `true` to turn off this feature.
2. __Hide Sub Total Columns__: The same as hiding the sub total rows, you may hide the sub total columns in pivot table by settigns `"hideSubtotalColumn"` to `true`.
3. __Show Data Headers__: In a pivot which has several data field caculation, showing data headers will make pivot look clear. To turn on this feature, you set `"showDataHeaders"` to `true`
